iOS 26 / Liquid Glass UI Refresh

The app has been completely overhauled with an updated design that fits with
iOS 26 and Liquid Glass. On previous iOS versions, the app should still look as
it did before and work correctly!


Share links  & deep links support

The app now supports creating and managing Paperless-ngx share links for
documents. This allows you to easily share documents with others by generating
a link that can be opened without logging in. In addition, app deep links are
now supported. You can open the app to a specific document, open the scanner,
manipulate the document view filter by opening a specifically built URL.

Document trash support

Deleted documents are moved to the trash. The app now supports viewing the
trash, restoring documents from the trash, and permanently deleting documents
from the trash. This allows you to recover documents that were accidentally
deleted and manage your document lifecycle more effectively.


Ready for OIDC

Paperless-ngx will gain the ability to log in with OpenID Connect (OIDC)
providers with mobile apps in an upcoming release. The app is ready to support
this!
